## Assignment: Understanding and Handling OOP/Java Exceptions:
### Objective 
The goal of this assignment is to enhance your understanding of exception handling in Java 
through practical examples. You will write small programs to simulate specific exceptions, 
demonstrate how they occur, and provide appropriate handling mechanisms. 
Each program should: 
 Simulate the exception in a meaningful scenario. 
 Include exception handling using try-catch blocks (and finally if needed). 
 Use comments to explain the code where necessary.
